# Programming an I2C Protocal in Assembly

In this project we aimed to recreate the I2C protocal to communicate with an real-time-clock (RTC). This included recreation of the SDA and SCL lines; where SDA is the data line and SCL is the clock line, in order to synchronize and send data between the microcontroller (MSP430FR2355) and the RTC (DS3231).
